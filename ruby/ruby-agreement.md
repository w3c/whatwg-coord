# Agreement on HTML Ruby Markup

The W3C will specify the extended HTML Ruby markup
described in [PR#6478](https://github.com/whatwg/html/pull/6478)
as a [REC track](https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/#rec-track) document.
The W3C and WHATWG believe this is within the bounds of our [MoU](https://www.w3.org/2019/04/WHATWG-W3C-MOU),
and while it is not the ideal outcome
(having Ruby documented in two places),
we understand that it serves the goals for the W3C's constituencies and existing implementations
to have an easily referencable document
as well as honoring the strict [requirements of the WHATWG](https://whatwg.org/working-mode#additions)
that the living standard not contain new additions
that don't have multi-browser-engine implementer commitments.

The <abbr title="Status Of This Document">SOTD</abbr> section of the W3C Ruby Extension spec
will state our joint intention
that the extended ruby markup definitions be fully integrated into the [WHATWG HTML specification](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/)
once they [meet WHATWG's inclusion criteria](https://whatwg.org/faq#adding-new-features)
under section [10.2 of the 2019 MOU](https://www.w3.org/2019/04/WHATWG-W3C-MOU#forking).

W3C editors will offer pull requests
to keep the HTML spec in sync,
both technically and editorially,
for the subset of features defined in both specs
(goal is to reduce the deltas
such that the only differences will be
the addition of the two new elements `<rb>` and `<rtc>`);
WHATWG HTML editors will work with the W3C Ruby Extension spec authors
to merge those pull requests in support of that goal.
