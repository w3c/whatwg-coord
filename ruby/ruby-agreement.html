<h1>Agreement on HTML Ruby Markup</h1>

<p>
The W3C will specify extended HTML Ruby markup
(based on <a href="https://github.com/whatwg/html/pull/6478">PR#6478</a>)
under the <a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/#rec-track">REC track</a>.
The W3C and WHATWG believe this is within the bounds of our <a href="https://www.w3.org/2019/04/WHATWG-W3C-MOU">MoU</a>,
and while it is not the ideal outcome
(having Ruby documented in two places),
we understand that it serves the goals for the W3C’s constituencies and existing implementations
to have an easily referencable document
as well as honoring the strict <a href="https://whatwg.org/working-mode#additions">requirements of the WHATWG</a>
that the living standard not contain new additions
that don’t have multi-browser-engine implementer commitments.

<p>
The <abbr title="Status Of This Document">SOTD</abbr> section of the W3C Ruby Extension spec
will state our joint intention
that the extended ruby markup definitions be fully integrated into the <a href="https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/">WHATWG HTML specification</a>
once they <a href="https://whatwg.org/faq#adding-new-features">meet WHATWG’s inclusion criteria</a>
under section <a href="https://www.w3.org/2019/04/WHATWG-W3C-MOU#forking">10.2 of the 2019 MOU</a>.

<p>
W3C editors may offer pull requests to keep the HTML spec in sync,
both technically and editorially,
for the subset of features defined in both specs,
so that readers of both specs can benefit from any improvements.
WHATWG HTML editors will review these contributions in good faith,
and merge those they deem acceptable
under the WHATWG <a href="https://whatwg.org/working-mode">working mode</a>.
